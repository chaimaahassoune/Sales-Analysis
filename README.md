## Analysis

### Best Month for Sales

The best month for sales was determined by analyzing total revenue for each month. The month with the highest revenue was identified.

### Top Selling City

The city with the highest total sales was identified by aggregating sales data based on city information.

### Optimal Advertisement Time

To maximize the likelihood of customer purchases, the analysis focused on determining the peak hours for sales. This information can guide the optimal time to display advertisements.

### Orders Per Hour

The number of orders per hour was analyzed for each city separately, providing insights into the buying patterns throughout the day.

### Products Sold Together

The analysis identified products that are frequently sold together, enabling the store to implement effective bundling or promotional strategies.

### Best Selling Product

The best-selling product was determined based on the highest quantity sold. Further analysis may provide insights into why this product performed exceptionally well.
